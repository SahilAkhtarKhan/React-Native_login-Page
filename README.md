# Login Page with Dark Theme in React Native

This is a simple login page built with React Native, implementing a dark theme using the `useColorScheme` hook.

## Description

This login page demonstrates how to implement a dark theme in a React Native application using the `useColorScheme` hook. The dark theme provides a visually appealing and user-friendly experience for users who prefer a darker color scheme.

## Features

- Dark theme implementation using the `useColorScheme` hook
- Input validation for email and password fields
- Login functionality with basic validation logic

## useColorScheme
The useColorScheme hook in React Native allows your app to subscribe to color scheme updates from the Appearance module. The Appearance module provides information about the user's preferred color scheme, which can be either light or dark.
The return value indicates the current user preferred color scheme. The value may be updated later, either through direct user action (e.g. theme selection in device settings) or on a schedule.
